    <h1>Community Service</h1>
    <p>I'm a big fan of contributing back to Crosby (my hometown), Houston, and generally anywhere else I can.
       Here I'll detail large-scale service projects I am engaged in, such as CASE (at the moment,
       that is all I am engaged in). This is not run-of-the-mill service hours you get for joining
       your high school's NHS chapter, I aim to make a significant contribution. If that is
       something you would like to contribute to, I encourage you to read on and find out how to
       support.
    </p>

      <h2>Crosby Association of STEM Excellence (CASE)</h2>
      <p>CASE is an organization some friends and I started in 2024. We made it to improve the quality of
        education in the sciences at our high school after we graduated, because it was clearly not on par.
        Through CASE, we give scholarships to students, mentorship, and we will soon expand to hosting competitions,
        free supplemental tutorials, and anything else we can cook up to support Crosby's STEM development.
      </p>
      <p>If you would like to donate, please email us. We are in the process of filing a 501(c) with the state
        to make the nonprofit official. Contributions do not have to be monetary, if you have any ideas, suggestions,
        or requests, please email! We also have a Facebook group where you can play a part in the contributions of CASE.
        See the links below.
